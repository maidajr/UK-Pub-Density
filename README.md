This is my map illustrating data I found in a pub survey done by the UK ONS. The data from the survey includes how many pubs are found in each region in the UK. I have taken that data and used region land area to calculate the density of pubs in each region of the UK. While my idea was that it would provide interesting data on the drinking habits of different regions of the UK, I quickly found out that this is in essence A glorified population densitiy map. Unfortinately A few more variables need to be factored in to gain any more insightful information.
